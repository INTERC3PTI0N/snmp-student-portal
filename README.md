# snmp-student-portal
Portal Website for SNMP Students

This Project was created by Final year computer Science students from SNMP. It's a conceptual idea on how a student dashboard can be implemented to provide easy access to educational and college material. This allows for interaction of various degrees between students and Lecturers. This is a full stack project built completely using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Firebase DB for backend storage.
